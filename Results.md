# Experimental results
I used the prewritten bash code and executed it on my Ubunut subsystem because I was testing my bats code there. So, I started with 3, then 10, and then 20 clients. All these took about a second, with 20 taking 2 seconds. I used the words.txt file which is fairly large. Then I passed it 50 clients and it took about 4 seconds. Im sure the way I did it is bad for memory usage, and maybe the file I used also wasn't big enough, but I had multiple programs and even spotify running in the background and it didn't even phase my system. No fans or extra heat production from my CPU either. Could probably push it and do a huge file, but didn't get around to it.

I didn't use a thread pool. I just wrote it simply and had it make a new thread for every client. My system is a laptop with 4 cores and 8gb of physical ram.
